        "Welcome to the Foundations of Machine Learning course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model a dataset with the purpose of prediction. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this Notebook, we will use a dataset to compute basic probability quantities. This will allow you to see how those concepts we review in the Lecture can actually be translated to Python code so that you can automate computation of basic probabilities. This will later on be useful to build basic probabilistic prediction models."

If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) that are based on the standard console.

        "Here we are using the command `film_deaths['Body_Count']>200` to index the films in the pandas data frame which have over 200 deaths. To sort them in order we can also use the `sort` command. The result of this command on its own is a data series of `True` and `False` values. However, when it is passed to the `film_deaths` data frame it returns a new data frame which contains only those values for which the data series is `True`. We can also sort the result. To sort the result by the values in the `Body_Count` column in *descending* order we use the following command."

        "Note a few things. We are interacting with our data. In particular, we are replotting the data according to what we have learned so far. We are using the programming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "

If we include an observation such as time, then in a probability this is known as *conditioning*. We use this notation, $P(Y=y|T=t)$, to condition the outcome on a second variable (in this case time). Or, often, for a shorthand we use $P(y|t)$ to represent this distribution (the $Y=$ and $T=$ being implicit). Because we don't believe a coin toss depends on time then we might write that\n",

The scatter plot of deaths vs year that we created above can be seen as a *joint* probability distribution. We represent a joint probability using the notation $P(Y=y, T=t)$ or $P(y, t)$ for short. Computing a joint probability is equivalent to answering the simultaneous questions, what's the probability that the number of deaths was over 40 and the year was 2002? Or any other question that may occur to us. Again we can easily use pandas to ask such questions.\n"
